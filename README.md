# The Bug Tracking System
# Team Name : BUG MAFIA


The Bug tracking System is an application that helps in tracking tickets raised to resolve bugs in a system/project. 
There are 3 main modules: 
1. Customer Module: A bug is reported in the project/system by the customer through the website by an agent. 
2. Manager Module: Once the ticket is created, manager looks for new tickets created and assigns it to the staff. Manager has authorities to move the ticket from one staff member to another.
